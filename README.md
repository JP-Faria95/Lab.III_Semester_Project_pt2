# Lab.III_Semester_Project_pt2

This repository is another possible submission to the Semester Project from the "Database Development Laboratory III" class.

As well as the pt.1 repository, the main goal from this project is to implement a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions into
a database on MySQL DBMS using PHP language for it. But now in this 2nd pt. was added HTML language so users can actually have a more interactive application. 

Laragon 2025 v 7.0.6 250204 was used as local host environment, PHP 8.4.4 and VSCode 1.98.0.

Important: The HTML code and design presented in this project is naturally very very simple and rustic as was my first time using any HTML syntaxes.
